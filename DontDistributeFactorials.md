# Theorem -
(A+B)! is always greater than (A!+B!) 
when A and B are inequal, natural numbers, 
and above or equal to one.

# Proof -
As our A or B approach infinity, (A+B)! - (A!+B!)
approaches infinity as well.

### Side note -
As a side note, we'd notice
a quite interesting pattern form at
the end of the differences, with our
number containing many of the digit '9'.
Factorials after 5 will always have a
zero at the end, since they'll always be
multiples of 2 and 5. Progressively, they'll
be multiplied by more numbers which are
multiples of 10, causing this artifact.
